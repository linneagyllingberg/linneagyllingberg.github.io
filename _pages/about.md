I am a Fulbright Scholar and Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Mathematics](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} at UCLA. My postdoctoral position at UCLA is generously supported by the [Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation's prestigious mathematics grant](https://kaw.wallenberg.org/en/press/18-mathematicians-receive-research-funding){:target="_blank"}, awarded to promote cutting-edge research in mathematics. I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from [Uppsala University](https://www.uu.se/en){:target="_blank"} within the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Mathematics](https://www.uu.se/en/department/mathematics/research/cim){:target="_blank"} in Sweden, where I was advised by [David Sumpter](https://www.katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N7-525){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on developing and analysing mathematical models and methods for various biological applications. I use dynamical systems, network models, and agent-based modelling, as well as statistical methods, to understand collective behaviour, decision-making, and complex systems. I am particularly interested in understanding the role of oscillations and network dynamics in basal cognition.
